abstract = {This book presents the state-of-the-art in various aspects of analysis and mining of online social networks. Within the broader context of online social networks, it focuses on important and upcoming topics of social network analysis and mining. The book collects chapters that are expanded versions of the best papers presented at the IEEE/ACM International Conference on Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining (ASONAM’2015), which was held in Paris, France in August 2015. All papers have been peer reviewed and checked carefully for overlap with the literature. The book will appeal to students and researchers in social network analysis/mining and machine learning.},

abstract = {<p>Nowadays, communication between people is mediated by technology and more specifically via Internet either by using email or social networking sites. Since any online activity generates an electronic trace, creating an automated tool to collect and analyze the communication between people can be valuable for extracting useful information about their behavioral characteristics. Combining these characteristics, with the ego network of each person within the network, additional analysis can be performed to detect the sphere of influence of the individual, identify other individuals in the network with similar behavioral characteristics and so on. In this paper, an automated tool has been designed and developed with the purpose to identify potential malevolent persons inside the organization. With this tool, we are able to analyze the communication between the employees of any given organization, build the behavioral profile of each individual, as well as their ego network.</p>},
